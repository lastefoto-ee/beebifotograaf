&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The birth of a child is undoubtedly one of the most wonderful events in life. Those tiny fingers and little facial features are a delight to the eyes, and it would be a mistake not to capture the very moment. It&amp;rsquo;s only once they&amp;rsquo;re so small and so cute. Let us capture your baby&amp;rsquo;s beauty in a beautiful and artistic way.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>it is advisable to book a time for the newborn photo shoot in advance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>newborn photo shoot takes place during the first 14 days of a baby&amp;rsquo;s life, so it is essential to announce the baby&amp;rsquo;s birth at the first opportunity, no matter how long you will be in the maternity hospital.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>at least one day before the photo shoot, mothers are advised not to eat the following foods: coffee, chocolate, citrus fruits, broccoli, garlic, spicy foods and nuts. Following this advice will increase the chances of a calm and sleepy baby.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>if possible, keep your baby awake for 1-2 hours before the photo shoot and feed him/her just before going to the studio.Choose clothes that are easy to remove and leave no marks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>please bring your baby&amp;rsquo;s pacifier with you, even if you choose not to use it. Often the pacifier is the key to a successful photo shoot.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>for a family shot you will need a T-shirt/blouse/dress (for mum) in a neutral (e.g. white, grey or black) or saturated colour. Avoid long sleeves and patterns/lettering on the clothes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you can make tea in the studio, for longer shoots take a small snack with you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>parents are welcome to send us their image and colour wishes, but please note that we unfortunately cannot guarantee that they will come true. All newborns are different and not all are willing to take the same poses or sleep deeply enough during the photo shoot.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>during the photo shoot, parents are also responsible for the older siblings who are in the studio.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Not really better, because by refusing to take a photo of a newborn, you are missing the opportunity to capture the important moments of your baby&amp;rsquo;s first days, which are truly worthy of your family photo album. The newborn looks so touching and tender right now. In a few months he/she will be completely different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./what-are-young-parents-afraid-of-1.jpg" alt="newborn photo shoot">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-take-a-photo-of-a-newborn-if-he-only-eats-and-sleeps">How to take a photo of a newborn if he only eats and sleeps?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Long and deep sleep is a real gift for a newborn photographer. With a sleeping baby, we can bring to life all photo ideas. But what to do when the baby is awake? In my practice, there were no babies who were awake throughout the entire newborn photo shoot. Although I always recommend setting aside enough time for photo shoot - about 2-3 hours and not planning important things (for example, going to the doctor) for the afternoon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./what-are-young-parents-afraid-of-2.jpg" alt="newborn photography">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="are-poses-safe-for-the-baby">Are poses safe for the baby?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Yes, the poses taken by an experienced newborn photographer are safe for the baby. They do not cause him any inconvenience - the baby continues to sleep peacefully and sweetly. When choosing a newborn photographer, make sure that he has the necessary qualifications. To do this, you can ask the photographer or see on the website what training courses he took in newborn photography.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./what-are-young-parents-afraid-of-3.jpg" alt="newborn photo shoot in Tallinn">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="newborn-photoshoot-usually-takes-place-in-the-studio-is-it-clean-enough">Newborn photoshoot usually takes place in the studio. Is it clean enough?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Yes, in photo studios intended for newbornphoto shoots, they monitor the cleanliness. Everything you need for shooting is in the studio. Here, a comfortable temperature for the baby is maintained, the props are regularly processed with products safe for newborns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./what-are-young-parents-afraid-of-4.jpg" alt="newborn session">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enjoy the first photo shoot in your baby&amp;rsquo;s life, because every moment is worth capturing! ❤️&lt;/p>
